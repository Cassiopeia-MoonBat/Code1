## Task 2

### Task 2.1
* HTML Hypertext Markup Language
* Tim Berners-Lee, 1991, published 1999, to enable researchers to share and link documents easily over the internet
* The first well-known public presentation of markup languages in computer text processing was made by William W. Tunnicliffe at a conference in 1967, although he preferred to call it generic coding
* Syntax is the arrangement of elements and attributes to create well-formed documents. example: Doctype declaration. 
  A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. example: <img>, <table>

### Task 2.2 
*The HTML DOM (Document Object Model) When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page. The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects:
